let bestPetDog = "Dogs are likely the most stereotypical pet for children â€“ and thereâ€™s a reason for that. Most average-sized dogs are large enough to avoid being injured by your child, but many breeds are also calm and laidback with children. Dogs easily live to a decade, so you shouldnâ€™t have to worry about having that uncomfortable conversation with your child. This species is also trainable and can usually go anywhere your child can, so they make good everyday companions."
